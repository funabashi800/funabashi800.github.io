      <description>Hello CoderðŸ¤©! Welcome to my personal blog! This post will show you how to deploy HUGO static site from GitHub to AWS S3 automatically via TravisCI.
Create S3 Bucket First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s make an S3 bucket to host static site, but before that, you need IAM account which has a managed permission to S3 because you have to need to deploy some files via TravisCI programmatically.
  Static Website Hosting     Public Access Control   After creating a S3 bucket allowed for public access, you need to attach some policy to the S3 bucket, because you are going to upload multiple file to S3 bucket programmatically.</description>
