      <description>Hello everyoneðŸ¤©! This post will show you how to deploy your static site to GitHub pages. In the last post, I introduced you to how to deploy HUGO&amp;rsquo;s static website to Amazon S3, but one of the consciousness must be the price. As far as a free tier, S3 will provide 5G in standard S3 storage, 20,000 GET/mon, and 2,000 PUT/mon.

      <description>Hello CoderðŸ¤©! Welcome to my personal blog! This post will show you how to deploy HUGO static site from GitHub to AWS S3 automatically via TravisCI.
Create S3 Bucket First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s make an S3 bucket to host static site, but before that, you need IAM account which has a managed permission to S3 because you have to need to deploy some files via TravisCI programmatically.
